### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Demographic Prediction based on Happy Moments
+ This project is conducted by Chao Yin

+ Project summary: A recommender system seeks to predict the "rating" a user would give to an item based on previous records and demographic information. Reversely, can we predict what the person is like given his/her preferences or  happy moments?`../data/topic_dict` is a folder of topic (e.g., entertainment, exercise etc.) dictionaries, where each file contains keywords that belong to the topic. We label the happy moments with topics and build a learning model based on MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) trying to recognize basic features of the users.
